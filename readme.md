# TypeScript project generator

This project has the goal to create a basic setup for a `TypeScript` project. It will create many files that are usually created manually. Currently the following files are being created:

- `.env`
- `.eslintignore`
- `.eslintrc.js`
- `.gitignore`
- `.prettier`
- `changelog.md`
- `Dockerfile`
- `heroku.yml` (optional)
- `LICENSE` (`MIT` as example)
- `nodemon.json`
- `package.json`
- `readme.md`
- `tsconfig.json`
- `webpack.config.js`

The following questions will be asked to the user:

- `Yarn or npm?`, only one of them is valid.
- `Project name:`, at least one character must be provided.
- `Project description:`, at least one character must be provided.
- `Author:`, at least one character must be provided.
- `Email:`, a correct email address must be provided.
- `Project version (0.1.0):` the initial version of the project, `0.1.0` as default.
- `Select your license [1...7]:`, the license you have chosen for the project.
- `License year (current year):`, the year where your license starts, current year as default.
- `Will this project be deployed with Heroku? [y/n]:`, yes or no question, only **y** or **n** is accepted. This is not case sensitive.
- ` Would you like to implement a express server with mongoose? [y/n]:`, yes or no question, only **y** or **n** is accepted. This is not case sensitive.

## What is new?

Please check the [`changelog.md`](https://github.com/AnthonyLzq/typescript-project-generator/blob/master/changelog.md) file.

## With `express` or without it?

### Without `express`

A `src` folder will be created with the following structure:

```
ðŸ“¦src
 â”— ðŸ“œindex.ts
```

### With `express`

A `src` folder will be created with the following structure:

```
ðŸ“¦src
 â”£ ðŸ“‚controllers
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œindex.ts
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œuser.ts
 â”£ ðŸ“‚custom
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œerror.ts
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œexpress.request.ts
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œexpress.response.ts
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œglobal.variables.ts
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œindex.ts
 â”£ ðŸ“‚dto-interfaces
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œindex.ts
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œuser.dto.ts
 â”£ ðŸ“‚models
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œindex.ts
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œuser.ts
 â”£ ðŸ“‚network
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œindex.ts
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œroutes.ts
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œserver.ts
 â”£ ðŸ“‚routes
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œhome.ts
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œindex.ts
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œuser.ts
 â”£ ðŸ“‚utils
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œindex.ts
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œresponse.ts
 â”— ðŸ“œindex.ts
```

Some considerations:

- If you choose this option, now you are able to run a server that has one main route, `home` (`/`), and another one, `user` (`/user` or `/user/:userId`).
- To connect your server with your `MongoDB` database, you need to provide your `uri` in the `.env` and uncomment the indicated lines in the `src/network/server.ts` file.
- Once you have done that, now you can perform the following `HTTP REQUEST`: `GET`, `POST`, `PATCH` and `DELETE`.
- In order to use the global variable declared in the `src/custom/global.variables.ts` file, you have to add the following lines in the external file you want to use it:
  ```typescript
  import { CustomNodeJSGlobal } from "/direction/to/global.variables/file"

  declare const global: CustomNodeJSGlobal
  ```
  Now, your are able to use the global variable.
- The provided project structure is inspired in my personal experience as [`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org/en/) developer and the [`Nest`](https://nestjs.com/) framework.
- The server is fully tested and has no errors (at least for now), feel free to report one [here](https://github.com/AnthonyLzq/typescript-project-generator/issues).
- Support for windows and linux platforms is available.
- Check the content of those files, here:

  - [`with-express`](https://github.com/AnthonyLzq/typescript-project-generator/tree/master/lib/templates/with-express)
  - [`without-express`](https://github.com/AnthonyLzq/typescript-project-generator/tree/master/lib/templates/without-express)

Finally, `git` will be initialized and a list of libraries will be installed. Check the [**notes**](#notes).
